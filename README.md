🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
📘 Project Description

This project focuses on predicting customer churn — identifying customers who are likely to stop using a company’s service.
By applying machine learning algorithms, the project helps businesses make data-driven decisions to reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer data to understand churn behavior.

Build predictive models to classify customers as churned or retained.

Compare different ML algorithms for performance.

Provide insights through data visualization.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Workflow

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize churn patterns and correlations.

Model Building – Apply and compare ML models:

Logistic Regression

KNeighbors Classifier

Support Vector Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation – Use metric like Accuracy

📈 Results

The Support Vector Classifier model provided the most accurate churn predictions.

Key features influencing churn include tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
